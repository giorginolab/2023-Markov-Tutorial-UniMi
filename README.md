Toni Giorgino (IBF-CNR), www.giorginolab.it, for Prof. Camilloni's course at the University of Milan.

To access "live" notebooks containing various takes on MSM calculations, in R and Python, see https://github.com/giorginolab/Markov-Tutorial-Data

See also [this Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kRKqlwEYjg3vwybqkQfNIKfojeKbEZS9?usp=sharing) which
  shows how to implement the same calculations in the [DeepTime](https://deeptime-ml.github.io/latest/index.html) library.
  
For different takes, see the [Markov-Tutorial-UniMi-2019](https://github.com/giorginolab/Markov-Tutorial-UniMi-2019) and
